# android_upload_sdk

Android upload SDK for SamsungVR service

Open this project with Android Studio 2.0

The SampleApp *does not* have an Android Studio based dependency
with SDKLib. Once you build SDKLib, the SDKLib-<build type>.jar
must be manually copied onto the SampleApp's lib directory.
